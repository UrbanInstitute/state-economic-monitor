The largest increase was in Alaska (16.0 percent), due mainly to rebounding <a href = \"https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/severance-taxes\">severance tax revenue</a> (although those revenues remain well below their 2014 levels). The next largest real total tax revenue increases were in Louisiana (8.8 percent), North Dakota (6.9 percent), and California (5.1 percent). Louisiana\u2019s increase came mostly from sales taxes, while California and North Dakota\u2019s gains were from higher income tax revenue.<br/><br/>The largest declines in real total tax revenue were in Florida (-10.4 percent), New Hampshire (-7.2 percent), and Iowa (-6.7 percent). In total, real total tax revenues fell in 12 states. Florida\u2019s revenue decline was mostly from lower sales tax collections, as were declines in Illinois, Mississippi, and South Carolina. New Hampshire, which does not have a state personal income tax or general sales tax, saw declines in corporate income tax revenue. Meanwhile, Iowa\u2019s lower revenues were spread across sales, income, and corporate income taxes. </p>

Real revenue declined in 26 of the 44 states with a broad-based corporate income tax.<br/><br/>State corporate income tax revenue is always volatile: profits fluctuate, the timing of tax payments changes as states offer amnesty programs, and previous losses can offset current profits. The new federal tax law could also affect corporate actions and investments. Moreover, corporate income taxes raise relatively little revenue, so relatively small changes in absolute dollars can create dramatic percentage changes.<br/><br/>\nAll of this is evident in Alaska, which saw a 355 percent real increase in corporate tax revenue over the past year (from $44 million to $202 million). This increase was driven by an improving economy and changes to <a href = \"https://gov.alaska.gov/newsroom/2016/06/governor-walker-vetoes-1-29-billion-to-preserve-state-savings/\" target=\"_blank\">tax credit rules</a> that had previously kept revenue low (if not negative). The next largest increases were in Montana (36.0 percent) and Missouri (32.6 percent).<br/><br/>Real corporate income tax revenue declined the most in Oklahoma (-42.7 percent), Arizona (-38.8 percent), and Florida (-22.0 percent). Eight other states experienced real corporate income tax revenue declines of 10.0 percent or more. </p>
