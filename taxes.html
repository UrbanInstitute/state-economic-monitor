This uptick tracks <a href = "https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/another-stellar-quarter-state-revenue-growth-pace-slowing-down">other reports</a> of increasing state tax revenue, but because some of this is related to how the <a href = "https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/feature/states-and-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a> interacts with state taxpayers and state tax systems, there is still a large degree of uncertainty about tax revenue growth going forward. These interactions include changes to federal and state tax law, which are more permanent, as well as one-time income shifts in response to the law.<br/><br/>Total real tax revenue increased in 48 states. Alaska\u2019s 55.6 percent increase in total tax revenue was the largest of any state. Although the state saw a large percentage increase in corporate income tax revenue, the total tax revenue increase was mostly attributable to increased <a href = "https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/severance-taxes">severance tax revenue</a>. Real total tax revenue increases were also high in other states with large amounts of severance tax revenue, such as North Dakota (25.5 percent), New Mexico (13.6 percent), Oklahoma (12.2 percent) and Texas (9.9 percent). Much of the recent growth in severance tax revenue, however, is a recovery from previously depressed levels.<br/><br/>Real total tax revenue declined in Ohio (-2.5 percent), the District of Columbia (-2.1 percent), and Mississippi (-0.4 percent).</p>

The new federal tax law also affected corporate investments and other business decisions that affect state taxes. Moreover, corporate income taxes raise relatively little revenue, so small changes in absolute dollars can create dramatic percentage changes. <br/><br/>This is evident in North Dakota, which saw a 119.6 percent real increase in corporate tax revenue over the past year (from $66 million to $145 million). The next largest increases were in Colorado (73.3 percent), Louisiana (69.6 percent), Alaska (59.5 percent), and Oklahoma (58.7 percent). In total, real revenue increased in 31 of the 44 states with a broad-based corporate income tax.<br/><br/>Real corporate income tax revenue declined the most in Indiana (-22.3 percent). The next largest decreases were in Michigan (-10.8 percent), Tennessee (-7.8 percent), and the District of Columbia (-7.8 percent). </p>
