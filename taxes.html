This uptick tracks <a href = "https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/another-stellar-quarter-state-revenue-growth-pace-slowing-down">other reports</a> of increasing state tax revenue, but because some of this is related to how the <a href = "https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/feature/states-and-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a> interacts with state taxpayers and state tax systems, there is still a large degree of uncertainty about tax revenue growth going forward. These interactions include changes to federal and state tax law, which are more permanent, as well as one-time income shifts in response to the law.<br/><br/>Total real tax revenue increased in 48 states. Alaska\u2019s 55.6 percent increase in total tax revenue was the largest of any state. Although the state saw a large percentage increase in corporate income tax revenue, the total tax revenue increase was mostly attributable to increased <a href = "https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/severance-taxes">severance tax revenue</a>. Real total tax revenue increases were also high in other states with large amounts of severance tax revenue, such as North Dakota (25.5 percent), New Mexico (13.6 percent), Oklahoma (12.2 percent) and Texas (9.9 percent). Much of the recent growth in severance tax revenue, however, is a recovery from previously depressed levels.<br/><br/>Real total tax revenue declined in Ohio (-2.5 percent), the District of Columbia (-2.1 percent), and Mississippi (-0.4 percent).</p>

None of these states changed its sales tax rate in the past two years.

The largest declines were in Louisiana (-11.2 percent) and California (-8.9 percent). Louisiana’s sales tax rate fell from <a href = "http://revenue.louisiana.gov/LawsPolicies/RIB%2018-016%20Decrease%20in%20State%20Sales%20Tax%20Rate%20to%20be%20Effective%20July%201%202018.pdf">5 percent to 4.45 percent</a> in July 2018.

The new federal tax law could also affect corporate investments and other business decisions that affect state taxes. Moreover, corporate income taxes raise relatively little revenue, so small changes in absolute dollars can create dramatic percentage changes.<br/><br/>This is evident in Alaska, which saw a 139 percent real increase in corporate tax revenue over the past year (from $58 million to $139 million). The next largest increases were in Montana (58.5 percent) and Hawaii (42.9 percent). Real revenue also increased in the District of Columbia and 29 of the 44 states with a broad-based corporate income tax.<br/><br/>Real corporate income tax revenue declined the most in Mississippi (-29.4 percent) and Indiana (-22.1 percent). Four other states experienced real corporate income tax revenue declines of 10.0 percent or more: Arizona, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Oklahoma. </p>
