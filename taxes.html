Michigan experienced the largest increase in total tax revenue at 14.9 percent. Michigan had strong increases in both sales and income tax revenue as its economy continued to recover. Wyoming (10.2 percent), Oregon (7.9 percent), Arizona (7.6 percent), New Mexico (7.3 percent), and Colorado (7.1 percent) had the next-highest increases in total tax revenue over the past year. In contrast, Alaska’s 47.8 percent decline was again a substantial outlier. Alaska relies on tax revenue from oil production far more than any other state, and falling Alaskan oil production has greatly affected the state’s total tax revenue. Eight other states had total tax revenue declines over the year: Connecticut (-2.8 percent), Wisconsin (-2.4 percent), Ohio (-1.7 percent), Washington (-1.6 percent), Illinois (-1.3 percent), North Carolina (-0.5 percent), Kansas (-0.4 percent), and Louisiana (-0.1 percent). All eight states had increases in sales tax revenue but decreases in income tax revenue (except for Washington which doesn’t have an income tax). See the following sections for more detail.</p>

Ohio’s 22.5 percent increase in sales tax revenue was the largest of any state, in part reflecting a quarter-point increase in the state’s sales tax rate in September 2013. Seven other states had sales tax revenue increase more than 10 percent: North Carolina (15.1 percent), North Dakota (14.1 percent), Arizona (14.0 percent), Michigan (12.4 percent), Iowa (12.1 percent), Wyoming (11.6 percent), and Colorado (10.1 percent). None of these states raised their sales tax rate over the past two years. Only two states had sales tax revenue declines over the year: Virginia (-1.4 percent) and South Carolina (-0.7 percent). Tax administration changes contributed to Virginia’s drop. Connecticut (0.9 percent) and Nebraska (0.6 percent) had sales tax revenue increases less than 1 percent. </p>

Hawaii (12.2 percent), Mississippi (10.1 percent), Michigan (8.5 percent), Oregon (7.1 percent), and Oklahoma (7.0 percent) had the largest income tax revenue increases. Income tax revenue declined in 13 states with a broad-based income tax (New Hampshire and Tennessee have narrow tax bases). Revenue was unchanged in Indiana. Tax revenue declined significantly in four states that recently passed large income tax cuts: Ohio (-10.4 percent), Wisconsin (-9.3 percent), Kansas (-7.2 percent), and North Carolina (-6.2 percent). These four states also saw total tax revenue decline over the year.</p>

In the 44 states with a broad corporate income tax (Nevada, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming do not tax corporate income;  South Dakota only taxes financial institutions; Ohio’s corporate income tax was repealed, but last year’s liabilities are still being collected), revenue changes ranged from a 39.4 percent decline in Louisiana to a 48.6 percent increase in Alabama. Louisiana’s decline is related to a <a href = "http://lfo.louisiana.gov/files/revenue/RevOutlook_05_19_14_REC.pdf" target="_blank">successful tax amnesty program in 2013</a>, while Alabama’s strong growth reflects a large <a href = "http://revenue.alabama.gov/documents/abstract/abs_112015.pdf" target="_blank">one-time payment in November 2014</a>. Twenty-four states saw revenue increases over the past year. These data show that state corporate income tax revenue is highly variable (e.g., profits fluctuate, the timing of tax payments changes, states offer amnesty programs) even when using four quarters of data.</p>
