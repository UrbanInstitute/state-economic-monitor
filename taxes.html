This uptick tracks other <a href = \"http://rockinst.org/issue-area/new-federal-tax-law-makes-it-difficult-for-states-to-provide-accurate-revenue-forecasts/\">reports of increasing state tax revenue</a>, but because some of this is related to how the <a href = \"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/feature/states-and-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act\">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a> interacts with state taxpayers and state tax systems, there is still a large degree of uncertainty going forward.<br/><br/>Total real tax revenues increased in 43 states and the District of Columbia. North Dakota\u2019s 11.8 percent increase in total tax revenue was the largest of any state. While the state saw large percentage increases in individual income tax and corporate income tax revenue, the total tax revenue increase was mostly because of rebounding <a href = \"https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/severance-taxes\">severance tax revenue</a>. The next largest real total tax revenue increases were in Oklahoma (8.5 percent) and Kansas (8.4 percent). Sales taxes and severance taxes were mostly responsible for Oklahoma\u2019s revenue growth, while individual income taxes drove Kansas\u2019s gains. Real total tax revenue also increased 5.0 percent or more in California, Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, Oregon, and Utah.<br/><br/>Real total tax revenue declined in seven states. The largest declines in real total tax revenue were in Iowa (-3.0 percent), Florida (-2.9 percent), New Hampshire (-2.5 percent), and Connecticut (-2.1 percent). The drop was less than 1.0 percent in North Carolina, Ohio, and Vermont. No tax was singularly responsible for the declines in these states. </p>

The largest drops were in New Mexico (-9.6 percent) and Iowa (-3.8 percent). Neither significantly changed their income taxes over the period, although <a href = \"https://href.li/?https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/05/republican-iowa-lawmakers-approve-massive-tax-cuts-reynolds-trump/583569002/\">Iowa</a> passed a large individual income tax cut during this year\u2019s legislative session.

The new federal tax law could also affect corporate investments and other business decisions that affect state taxes. Moreover, corporate income taxes raise relatively little revenue, so small changes in absolute dollars can create dramatic percentage changes.<br/><br/>This is evident in Alaska, which saw a 139 percent real increase in corporate tax revenue over the past year (from $58 million to $139 million). The next largest increases were in Montana (58.5 percent) and Hawaii (42.9 percent). Real revenue also increased in the District of Columbia and 29 of the 44 states with a broad-based corporate income tax.<br/><br/>Real corporate income tax revenue declined the most in Mississippi (-29.4 percent) and Indiana (-22.1 percent). Four other states experienced real corporate income tax revenue declines of 10.0 percent or more: Arizona, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Oklahoma. </p>
