Real revenue declined in 23 of the 44 states with a broad-based corporate income tax.<br/><br/>State corporate income tax revenue is always volatile: profits fluctuate, the timing of tax payments change as states offer amnesty programs, and prior losses can offset current profits. Uncertain but expected reforms to federal tax law could also affect corporate actions and investments. Further, corporate income taxes raise relatively little revenue, which means relatively small dollar changes can create dramatic percentage changes.<br/><br/>All of this is evident in Alaska, which saw an increase of over 17,000 percent over the past year as corporate tax revenues rose from $1 million last year to $140 million at the end of the third quarter of 2017. Both an improving economy and changes to <a href = \"https://gov.alaska.gov/newsroom/2016/06/governor-walker-vetoes-1-29-billion-to-preserve-state-savings/\" target=\"_blank\">tax credit rules</a> that had previously kept revenue low (if not negative) contributed to the increase. Similarly, Hawaii's real corporate income tax revenue increased 166.3 percent. The next highest increase was Maine's 13.7 percent increase.<br/><br/>Real corporate income tax revenue declined the most in Oklahoma (-35.6 percent), North Dakota (-33.4 percent), and Arizona (-33.2 percent).
