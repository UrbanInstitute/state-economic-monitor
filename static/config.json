Real revenue declined in 26 of the 44 states with a broad-based corporate income tax.<br/><br/>State corporate income tax revenue is always volatile: profits fluctuate, the timing of tax payments changes as states offer amnesty programs, and previous losses can offset current profits.

Moreover, corporate income taxes raise relatively little revenue, so relatively small changes in absolute dollars can create dramatic percentage changes.<br/><br/>All of this is evident in Alaska, which saw a 355 percent real increase in corporate tax revenue over the past year (from $44 million to $202 million). This increase was driven by an improving economy and changes to <a href = \"https://gov.alaska.gov/newsroom/2016/06/governor-walker-vetoes-1-29-billion-to-preserve-state-savings/\" target=\"_blank\">tax credit rules</a> that had previously kept revenue low (if not negative).
