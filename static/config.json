In contrast, Louisiana\u2019s increase was because of changes in state law. For much of 2015, the <a href = \"https://www.businessreport.com/article/louisiana-corporate-franchise-tax-collections-back-black\" target=\"_blank\">state paid more in credits</a> than it collected in tax revenue, reflecting corporate tax rules and declining prices for natural resources. <a href = \"https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=985189\" target=\"_blank\">Reforms</a> in 2016 ensured the tax would bring in more revenue: corporate income tax revenue jumped from roughly $127 million in in the year ending in the first quarter in 2016 to $265 million the next year.
