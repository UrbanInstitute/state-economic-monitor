The largest decline was in New Mexico (-45.2 percent). State corporate income tax revenue is always volatile: profits fluctuate, the timing of tax payments change as states offer amnesty programs, and current profits can be offset against prior losses. But the largest increase compared with last year is off the chart: Louisiana\u2019s corporate income tax revenue was 1,210.6 percent higher in 2016 than 2015 because of changes in state law. For much of 2015, the <a href = \"https://www.businessreport.com/article/louisiana-corporate-franchise-tax-collections-back-black\">state paid more in credits</a> than it collected in tax revenue, reflecting corporate tax rules and declining prices for natural resources. The <a href = \"https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=985189\">state passed reforms in 2016</a>that ensured the tax would bring in more revenue. Consequently, Louisiana collected roughly $20 million in corporate income tax revenue in 2015 and $270 million in 2016. "

Some non-resource-dependent states, such as Illinois, Maine, Montana, and New York, however, also saw real tax revenue declines greater than 3.0 percent, mostly because of declines in income tax revenues (though only <a href = \"http://www.maine.gov/revenue/rules/legischange16.htm#individual\" target=\"_blank\">Maine</a> enacted income tax cuts last year).
