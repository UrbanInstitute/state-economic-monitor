The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also affected corporate investments and other business decisions that affect state taxes. Moreover, corporate income taxes raise relatively little revenue (only 2 percent of state general revenue in 2016), so small changes in absolute dollars can create dramatic percentage changes.<br/><br/>This is evident in New Mexico, which saw a 158.9 percent real increase in corporate tax revenue over the past year\u2014from $70 million to $182 million. For perspective, New Mexico\u2019s total tax revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $1.8 billion.
