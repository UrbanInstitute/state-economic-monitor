The new federal tax law also affected corporate investments and other business decisions that affect state taxes. Moreover, corporate income taxes raise relatively little revenue, so small changes in absolute dollars can create dramatic percentage changes. <br/><br/>This is evident in North Dakota, which saw a 119.6 percent real increase in corporate tax revenue over the past year (from $66 million to $145 million). The next largest increases were in Colorado (73.3 percent), Louisiana (69.6 percent), Alaska (59.5 percent), and Oklahoma (58.7 percent).
