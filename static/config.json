The new federal tax law also affected corporate investments and other business decisions that affect state taxes. Moreover, corporate income taxes raise relatively little revenue, so small changes in absolute dollars can create dramatic percentage changes.<br/><br/>This is evident in Alaska, which saw a 116.7 percent real increase in corporate tax revenue over the past year (from $90 million to $142 million). The next largest increases were in North Dakota (74.3 percent), Louisiana (62.6 percent), and Hawaii (58.4 percent). In total, real revenue increased in 29 of the 44 states with a broad-based corporate income tax.<br/><br/>Real corporate income tax revenue declined the most in Indiana (-33.5 percent).
