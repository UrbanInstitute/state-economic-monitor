The new federal tax law could also affect corporate investments and other business decisions that affect state taxes. Moreover, corporate income taxes raise relatively little revenue, so small changes in absolute dollars can create dramatic percentage changes.<br/><br/>This is evident in Alaska, which saw a 139 percent real increase in corporate tax revenue over the past year (from $58 million to $139 million). The next largest increases were in Montana (58.5 percent) and Hawaii (42.9 percent). Real revenue also increased in the District of Columbia and 29 of the 44 states with a broad-based corporate income tax.<br/><br/>Real corporate income tax revenue declined the most in Mississippi (-29.4 percent) and Indiana (-22.1 percent).
