Overall, 25 states and DC had second-quarter house prices 10.0 percent or more above their early 2007 levels. \n\nBut recent price changes have not necessarily been enough to offset long-term trends. Since its 2011 housing price trough, Nevada has experienced continued strong annual price growth (7.8 percent in the second quarter of 2017), but that has not been nearly enough to recover from its overall drop in prices since the 2007 prerecession peak. Meanwhile, Alaska\u2019s housing prices fell 0.3 percent from the second quarter of 2016, despite growing over ten percent since 2007. Resource-dependent states such as Alaska and North Dakota experienced housing price appreciation during the oil boom when prices were high, but they have since leveled off as oil prices and production have dropped.

However, Alaska\u2019s total tax revenues were still less than half the revenue for the same period ending in 2015.<br/><br/>Tax revenue grew 14.9 percent in Louisiana, the second-highest growth among the states, mainly because of sales tax revenue increases described below.
