Nevada, Ohio, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming do not tax corporate income; South Dakota taxes only financial institutions. Oklahoma experienced the largest decline (-51.9 percent).<br/><br/>State corporate income tax revenue is always volatile: profits fluctuate, the timing of tax payments change as states offer amnesty programs, and prior losses can offset current profits.

Hawaii\u2019s gain was the result of higher corporate profits; the state did not legislate any tax changes during the period. In contrast, Louisiana\u2019s increase was because of changes in state law. For much of 2015, the <a href = \"https://www.businessreport.com/article/louisiana-corporate-franchise-tax-collections-back-black\" target=\"_blank\">state paid more in credits</a> than it collected in tax revenue, reflecting corporate tax rules and declining prices for natural resources. <a href = \"https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=985189\" target=\"_blank\">Reforms</a> in 2016 ensured the tax would bring in more revenue: corporate income tax revenue jumped from roughly $127 million in in the year ending in the first quarter in 2016 to $265 million the next year.
