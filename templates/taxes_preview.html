This uptick tracks <a href = "https://www.urban.org/research/publication/state-tax-revenues-soar-first-quarter-2018">other reports</a> of increasing state tax revenue, but because some of this is related to how the <a href = "https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/feature/states-and-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a> there is still a large degree of uncertainty going forward. These interactions include both changes to federal and state tax law, which are more permanent, as well as one-time income shifts in response to the law.<br/><br/>Total real tax revenue increased in 46 states and the District of Columbia. North Dakota\u2019s 17.3 percent increase in total tax revenue was the largest of any state. Although the state saw large percentage increases in individual income tax and corporate income tax revenue, the total tax revenue increase was mostly because of increased <a href = "https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/severance-taxes">severance tax revenue</a>. Real total tax revenue increases were also greater than 10 percent in Alaska, Kansas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Severance tax revenue rebounding from previously weak levels was also mostly responsible for revenue gains in Alaska, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.<br/><br/>Real total tax revenue declined in four states. The largest declines were in Ohio (-3.0 percent) and Washington (-2.1 percent); the drop was less than 1.0 percent in Mississippi and Tennessee.</p>

The largest drops were in New Mexico (-9.6 percent) and Iowa (-3.8 percent). Neither significantly changed their income taxes over the period, although <a href = "https://href.li/?https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/05/republican-iowa-lawmakers-approve-massive-tax-cuts-reynolds-trump/583569002/">Iowa</a> passed a large individual income tax cut during this year's legislative session.

The new federal tax law could also affect corporate investments and other business decisions that affect state taxes. Moreover, corporate income taxes raise relatively little revenue, so small changes in absolute dollars can create dramatic percentage changes.<br/><br/>This is evident in Alaska, which saw a 139 percent real increase in corporate tax revenue over the past year (from $58 million to $139 million). The next largest increases were in Montana (58.5 percent) and Hawaii (42.9 percent). Real revenue also increased in the District of Columbia and 29 of the 44 states with a broad-based corporate income tax.<br/><br/>Real corporate income tax revenue declined the most in Mississippi (-29.4 percent) and Indiana (-22.1 percent). Four other states experienced real corporate income tax revenue declines of 10.0 percent or more: Arizona, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Oklahoma. </p>
